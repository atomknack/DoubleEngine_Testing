Unity Tutorial License MIT-0 and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
All Catlike Coding Unity tutorials are available under two licenses, 
one for the code & assets and another for the tutorials themselves.

Code & Asset License
The below MIT-0 license applies to all code, textures, and other Unity project files 
that are made available as part of my tutorials. 
It's the MIT license without the attribution part. 
This means that you can use the content without restriction. 
You do not have to include a license file in your project. 
You also do not have to give me credit, but I sure appreciate it if you do.

Tutorial License
The Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International 
(CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license applies to all my tutorials. 
By this I mean the actual tutorials, not what they demonstrate. 
It covers the text, screenshots, diagrams, graphs, animations, PDFs, 
and other media that together form a tutorial. 
It doesn't apply to the code & assets, but it does apply to their presentation: 
insertion and deletion styling and such.

Translating My Tutorials
You can translate my work and host it somewhere else, 
as long as you abide by the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license mentioned above. 
I cannot vouch for the quality of translations.
